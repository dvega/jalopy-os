            artifacts which Jalopy depends on, while maintaining
            most of the ant capabilities. The following projects
            can now be built using maven. Jalopy-core,
            Jalopy-Eclipse, Jalopy-Console, Jalopy-Ant</td>

            inheritence order.</td>
            <td>The jalopy printers should be more uniform. There
            are a lot of similarites between various code
            renderings like the method, enum, enumdef and
            annotation printer. It would be nice if all these
            meshed a little better together</td>
