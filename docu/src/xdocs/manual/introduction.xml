Jalopy is a source code formatting tool for the Sun Java Programming Language.
It can insert and remove indentation, enforce brace styles, wrap lines, sort
and group imports, add headers and footers, handle whitespace, insert/remove
and correct Javadoc entries to match method signatures and much more.

<para>
If your development team can agree on a coding style, Jalopy can help you
maintain it, without any browbeating or bloodletting. With a simple Ant target,
you can format all the source into the style, as often as you like.

<para>
Jalopy is written in Java and there are several Plug-ins available to integrate
the formatting engine into some of the more popular Java applications, including Ant,
Eclipse, JBuilder, JDeveloper, jEdit and NetBeans/Sun ONE Studio.
