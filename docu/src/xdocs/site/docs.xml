<title>Documentation</title>

<para>
Jalopy comes with a complete and (hopefully) useful manual. It is mostly driven by
example as I find this the simplest approach to explain the myriad of switches.

<para>
Note that the documentation is a work-in-progress. It could definitely benefit 
from your feedback. I'm no native speaker and providing good documentation is 
the hardest part for me regarding this project. All remarks, corrections, additions... are
highly welcome.
