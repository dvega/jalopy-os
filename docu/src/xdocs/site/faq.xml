How do I report a bug I have found in Jalopy?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
To be as helpful as possible to the Jalopy developer team and other users, you should use
the <ulink url="http://sf.net/tracker/?group_id=45216&amp;atid=442212">
bug tracker database</ulink> that the Jalopy project maintains on the
<ulink url="http://sf.net/">SourceForge web site</ulink>. You do need to be a SourceForge
member to post a bug report.
</para>
<para>
Before posting a bug report, spend a few moments searching the bug database to see if a
similar report has already been made. The bug tracker has a search facility that will let
you search for bug reports using a variety of criteria. If you find a similar bug report,
and you have additional information to contribute, post a comment to the report. Only if
you do not find a similar bug report, submit a new one.

<question id="bug-report"><para>
What information should I include in a bug report?
</para></question>
<answer><para>
The web form in the bug tracker report provides several fields for
submitting information. If you are unsure about a particular
item, leave it at the default setting provided in the form.
</para>
<para>
The more important fields are <quote>Category</quote>,
<quote>Summary</quote> and the <quote>Initial comment</quote>.
</para>

<para>
When you write your initial comment describing the bug, you
should specify the versions of Jalopy, the Plug-in environment, the Java platform and
operating system you are using.
</para>

<para>
Be as specific as possible. If you encounter stack traces, attach them. If you have
problems formatting a specific file, locate the cause of the error and attach
the code section as a text file. Also attach your code convention as many errors only
occur with a certain settings combination.
</para>

<para>
A more typical example should look like:

<programlisting>
I newly installed jalopy-1.0b9 on Windows NT with German locales, Sun JDK 1.3.1_05.
I upgraded property file from jalopy-1.0b7 via Import/Export.

When starting the jalopy settings dialog, I always have problems
when I am on the "Sorting" panel. No entries are shown. Maybe
this is a similar problem.

I tried with different files. Always the same result.

Using the Ant task (0.3.3 with Ant 1.4.1), I get a stack trace as attached. I attached
my code convention also.

<para>
The attached stack trace could read as follows:

</programlisting>
</informalexample>

<para>
The given information made it quite obvious that the auto-conversion of the code
convention format from 1.0b7 to 1.0b9 failed for some reason.
</para>

<para>
Looking further at the supplied code convention revealed that the value of the sorting
key was invalid and the actual cause was easy to spot.
