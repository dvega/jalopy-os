/**
 * Extends the standard button group to allow empty groups. Again creating a
 * set of buttons with the same <em>EmptyButtonGroup</em> object means that
 * turning 'on' one of those buttons turns 'off' all other buttons in the
 * group. The difference between <em>EmptyButtonGroup</em> and
 * <em>ButtonGroup</em> lies in the fact that the currently selected button
 * can be deselected which results - in an empty group.

 * Note that the original documentation for <em>ButtonGroup</em> (as of JDK

 * state of the added buttons (They claim 'Initially, all buttons in the
 * group are unselected').
