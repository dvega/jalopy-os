package de.hunsicker.util.concurrent;

/**
 * Thrown by synchronization classes that report timeouts via exceptions. The
 * exception is treated as a form (subclass) of InterruptedException. This
 * both simplifies handling, and conceptually reflects the fact that
 * timed-out operations are artificially interrupted by timers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class was taken from the util.concurrent package written by Doug Lea.
