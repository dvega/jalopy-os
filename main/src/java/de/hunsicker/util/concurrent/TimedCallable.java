package de.hunsicker.util.concurrent;

/**
 * TimedCallable runs a Callable function for a given length of time. The
 * function is run in its own thread. If the function completes in time, its
 * result is returned; otherwise the thread is interrupted and an
 * InterruptedException is thrown.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: TimedCallable will always return within the given time limit (modulo
 * timer inaccuracies), but whether or not the worker thread stops in a
 * timely fashion depends on the interrupt handling in the Callable
 * function's implementation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class was taken from the util.concurrent package written by Doug Lea.
